      Each of these examples has two parts - a sketch that works with analysed data,
      and another sketch which does the analysis. The latter are called 'remotes'. You can,
      for example run a remote on your mobile phone (thus using its microphone), and further
      processing and using the data on your laptop.

   Sketches for extending. They are listed in ascending complexity.
   <ul>
      <li><a href="sketches/speed-of-nose/">Speed of nose</a>: Demonstrates how to get the speed (m/s) of a body part exemplified by the nose. Also, draws eyes as stars</li>
      <li><a href="sketches/wrist-distance/">Wrist distance</a>: Demonstrates how to get the distance (m) between two body parts in this case left and right wrist</li>
      <li><a href="sketches/multibody/">Multiple bodies</a>: Demonstrates how to track multiple bodies from one camera. When multiple bodies are detected with the same camera data are 2D. No depth (z-value) is available and measurements are in pixels not meters
